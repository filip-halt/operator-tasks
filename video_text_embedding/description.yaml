task-name: "Video/Text Embedding"
description: "Video/Text embedding task comprehens video and language together, and encodes both video's and text's semantics into a same embedding space. With the increasing of videos uploaded online every day, video-text retrieval is becoming an emerging requirement for people to find relevant videos efficiently. Beyond the actual web application, video/text embedding is a fundamental task for multi-modal visual and language understanding."
