task-name: "Molecular Fingerprinting"
description: "A Molecular Fingerprinting Operator encodes a Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry Specification (SMILES) as a fingerprint. The fingerprint can represent elements, atom pairs, or functional groups, etc., and are often used for substructure searches and similarity searches in drug discovery."
